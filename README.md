# Stable Diffusion Localized Noise Function
Final Project Submission for LIGN 167 ("Deep Learning for Natural Language Understanding") Fall 2022. 

Group: Alice Chamberlin, Nathaniel Satriya, and Evelyn Yee

In this project, we explore the effect of custom noise functions for Stable Diffusion, with the goal of custom inpainting funtionality. Our process, results, and takeaways are described in the writeup .pdf file. Our code is provided in the .ipynb and .py files.
